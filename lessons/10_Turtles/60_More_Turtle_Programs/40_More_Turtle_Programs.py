"""
Copy the code from the previous lesson, 08a_More_Turtle_programs.ipynb, 
from the section " Click on the Turtle"

Then change the code so that the turtle has a different image ( look in the 'images'
directory ) and when you click on it, it moves to a random location on the screen.

Use this code to get a random x and y location

    import random
    x = random.randint(-300, 300)
    y = random.randint(-300, 300)

# Double click on this cell to copy the code

screen.setup(600, 600,0,0)
screen.bgcolor('dark gray')

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.penup()
t.shape("turtle")

# This is the function that gets called when you click on the screen

    and make the turtle move to the clicked location."""

turtle.done() # Important! Use `done` not `exitonclick` to keep the window open
